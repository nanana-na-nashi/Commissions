The settings can be controlled through Unity animations. The easiest way to do so, is to create an Animator on the same object the `VSF_SetEffect...` components are attached to and animating them that way.
* Added a `VSF_SetBlendShapeClip` component to the VSeeFace SDK which allows overriding VRM blend shape clip values, which can also trigger custom animations according to the VSF_Animations component

* Made it so that the hip bone's X and Z offsets are zeroed out at load time
* Added an invisible floor plane
* Improved the error message that appears when the tracker process disappears

Version 1.13.32b:
* The version number was actually not changed. This fixes some issues where the tracker wouldn't start due to an incompatible version of DLLs being included. The issue only appears on systems without VC++ runtime files installed, so if 1.13.32 is working fine for you, there is no need to download again.
